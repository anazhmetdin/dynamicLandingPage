                            inflated the "critical thinking" percentage so people could actually

                            Dunder Mifflin, Scranton branch. Dwight formally held the title of 
                            "Assistant to the Regional Manager", but constantly refers to himself 
                            as "Assistant Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to 
                            second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott. Dwight craves 
                            authority over his co-workers and relishes any minor task that Michael 
                            or anyone else will give him.
